# Shark Attack Data Analysis

This project analyzes shark attack data to uncover patterns and trends related to various factors such as activity type, temporal distribution, victim demographics, geographic locations, and injury specifics.

## Objectives

1. **Distribution of Shark Attacks by Activity**

   - **Purpose**: Identify which water activities (e.g., surfing, swimming, diving) are associated with higher incidences of shark attacks.

2. **Total Number of Shark Attacks per Decade**

   - **Purpose**: Examine the temporal distribution of shark attacks to identify trends and fluctuations over time.

3. **Risk Assessment of Water Activities**

   - **Purpose**: Determine which water activities carry a higher risk of shark attacks to inform safety guidelines and preventive measures.

4. **Distribution by Victim’s Gender and Age Group**

   - **Purpose**: Analyze the demographic characteristics of shark attack victims to identify vulnerable populations.

5. **Annual Shark Attacks Since 1900**

   - **Purpose**: Visualize the number of shark attacks annually over time since 1900 to identify long-term trends and patterns.

6. **Geographic Distribution of Shark Attacks**

   - **Purpose**: Identify countries with the highest reports of shark attacks and pinpoint specific areas and locations within those countries that are most affected.

7. **Commonly Injured Body Parts**

   - **Purpose**: Determine which body parts are most frequently injured in shark attacks through text analysis of the Injury column.

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Standardize and clean data fields such as activity type, date, location, and injury description to ensure consistency and accuracy.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilize statistical methods and visualizations to explore the dataset and extract meaningful insights.

- **Visualization**: Create graphs and charts to illustrate findings, including bar charts for activity distribution, line graphs for temporal trends, and maps for geographic distribution.

- **Text Analysis**: Perform natural language processing on the Injury column to extract information about commonly injured body parts.

## Expected Outcomes

- Identification of high-risk activities and recommendations for individuals engaging in these activities.

- Understanding of temporal trends to inform policy decisions and resource allocation for beach safety.

- Insights into demographic factors that may influence vulnerability to shark attacks.

- Geographic mapping of shark attack hotspots to aid in targeted safety campaigns.

- Information on common injury patterns to assist medical professionals in preparedness and treatment strategies.

## Notes

- This analysis is based on historical data and is intended for informational purposes.

- While patterns can be identified, shark behavior is inherently unpredictable, and caution should always be exercised in marine environments.

- The data may have limitations, including underreporting or misclassification, which should be considered when interpreting the results.
